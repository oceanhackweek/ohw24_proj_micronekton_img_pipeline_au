**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here.
* `data` Shared dataset can be shared here. Note, do not put large datasets on GitHub. Speak to the organizers if you 
need to share large datasets. Each team member can have a version of the dataset locally in the same folder to 
preserve relative paths, but the dataset does not need to be added to git/GitHub (you can use `.gitignore`).

You can start with a simple structure and as you progress you can refine it to contain more components. [Here](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/#directory-structure) is an example of a more elaborate structure for a data science project.
